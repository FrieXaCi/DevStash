## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server (Turbopack) on http://localhost:3000. Only one `next dev` per project can run; a second one exits with "Another next dev server is already running" and prints the existing PID.
- `npm run build` — production build (also type-checks)
- `npm run start` — serve the production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint (flat config, `eslint-config-next` core-web-vitals + typescript)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — type-check only

There is no test framework set up yet.
